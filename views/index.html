<h1>Next Router</h1>

<p>
    The router is a <strong>smart proxy server</strong> that determines where an incoming HTTP
    request should be directed to based on the URL pattern and several
    other HTTP headers.
</p>
<p>
    The rules under which the router operates are stored in the
    <a href="http://next-service-registry.herokuapp.com/">next service registry</a>.
